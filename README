Introduction:
-------------

This file is a part of bsc and/or libbsc, a program and a library for
lossless, block-sorting data compression.

bsc is a high performance file compressor based on lossless,
block-sorting data compression algorithms.

libbsc is a library based on bsc, it uses the same algorithms
as bsc and enables you to compress memory blocks.

libdivsufsort:
--------------

The libdivsufsort project provides a fast, lightweight, and robust
C API library to construct the suffix array and the Burrows-Wheeler
transformed string for any input string of a constant-size alphabet.
libbsc uses libdivsufsort for constructing Burrows-Wheeler transform.
