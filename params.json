{"name":"Libbsc","body":"### Introduction\r\nThis site is a part of bsc and libbsc, a program and a library for lossless data compression. bsc is a high performance file compressor based on lossless, block-sorting data compression algorithms. libbsc is a library based on bsc, it uses the same algorithms as bsc and enables you to compress memory blocks.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* The source code is available under LGPL license.\r\n* GPU acceleration using NVIDIA CUDA technology.\r\n* 64 bit and multi-core systems support.\r\n* Highly optimized code and C++ interface for superior performance.\r\n* Multiple algorithms that allows software fine-tuning for maximum speed or compression efficiency.\r\n* CRC-32 calculation routine for data integrity verification.\r\n* In-place compression and decompression to save memory. \r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\nTypically, bsc outperform modern compression programs like gzip and bzip2 by speed and/or compression. You can find results of independent benchmarking of bsc on http://compressionratings.com/i_bsc.html website where it is currently ranked in Top3 in Database1, Image1, Medical1, Medical2, PGN1, Source1, Text1 and Text2 tests.","tagline":"High performance block-sorting data compression library","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
